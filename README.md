## Legal / Disclaimer
This is in no way associated or similar to CVCX. I have heard of the software and am attempting to achieve similar functionality but I have never used it or seen any of the math they use. If there happens to be any similar math, then that must be a coincidence and must have been the best or easiest way to do it.
